# How We Can Automate Customer Support with NeuroLink

## The Challenge
Companies face thousands of repetitive support queries across email, chat, and in-app messages—leading to overloaded agents and long response times.

## The Solution
We built an AI-first support system that integrates with CRM platforms, engineering tools like GitHub, and internal documentation to handle both simple and complex queries efficiently.

## Enter NeuroLink
NeuroLink connects seamlessly to systems like Salesforce, Zendesk, GitHub, and internal product manuals. It leverages multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini), dynamically selecting the most suitable model based on query type.

### Smart Query Routing
- Simple queries are routed to fast, low-cost models.
- Complex technical questions go to advanced models like GPT-4 or Claude—ensuring a balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and accuracy.

### Real Integrations in Action
- **CRM Example:** NeuroLink fetches refund or order details directly from platforms like Salesforce.
- **GitHub Example:** It searches engineering repositories and issue trackers to provide accurate bug context or resolutions.
- **Documentation Example:** It scans internal manuals to provide step-by-step answers—no predefined scripting needed.

### Behind the Scenes
- **generateText:** AI-generated response
- **context:** Includes session or user metadata
- **enableEvaluation:** Ensures response clarity and accuracy
- **MCP tools:** Handle CRM, GitHub, and documentation access
- **Fallbacks:** Seamlessly switch providers on failure
